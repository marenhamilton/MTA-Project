    "Hope you are well! We pulled the mta data from the public data portal and ran some initial feasibility analyses. Check out the attached document. With the MTA data alone, we can definitely help you to find places to deploy your teams to access the most people per day.

    "## Draft Proposal:\n",
    "​\n",
    "### WTWY street teams\n",
    "​\n",
    "#### Problem statement:\n",
    "​\n",
    "WTWY needs to optimize their street teams so that they can get the most email signups for their annual OMGYN Gala. Ideally, the email signups will convert at a high rate to gala attendees, and among attendees, many will make contributions to WTWY.\n",
    "​\n",
    "MTA data obtained from the NYC Data Portal provides rich information about the travel patterns of New Yorkers -- using this information, can we create a street team deployment plan that will optimize WTWY’s resources toward achieving their goals?\n",
    "​\n",
    "#### Preliminary results:\n",
    "​\n",
    "Here are some preliminary results we found, as a taste of what we can do.\n",
    "​\n",
    "Most overall traffic:\n",
    "​\n",
    "Let’s start at the start and simply see where the most traffic is. This has a lot of assumptions baked into it, so we’ll examine these and refine our recommendations as we continue.\n",
    "​\n",
    "Top five stations in terms of average daily turnstile entrances:\n",
    "​\n",
    "1. 34th St - Penn Station\n",
    "2. 42nd St - Grand Central Station\n",
    "3. 34th St - Herald Square\n",
    "4. 14th St - Union Sq\n",
    "5. 42nd St - Times Sq\n",
    "​\n",
    "    [make a table or chart to put here instead of list]\n",
    "​\n",
    "We can also break this down by day:\n",
    "​\n",
    "    [chart or table broken down by day]\n",
    "​\n",
    "​\n",
    "Can we filter out the tourists?\n",
    "​\n",
    "So far, this assumes that any subway rider is equally likely to sign up for the Gala email list. Of course, this is not the case. There are a number of ways to narrow down stations to those that would maximize the number of people aligned with the ideals of WTWY, many of which would involve external data sources. But we wanted to see what we could do with the MTA data alone.\n",
    "​\n",
    "One thing we thought would be helpful would be to find stations where the number of tourists is low (people who will not be around to attend the Gala) and most riders are native New Yorkers (people who will). Stations that are used primarily for commuting will have many more native residents than those that are popular tourist locations.\n",
    "​\n",
    "We identified in the data a signature of commuter travel: stations with high and consistent usage on weekdays, and low utilization on the weekend [a]. Stations that are popular with tourists have less of a difference between weekend and weekday travel [b], or are much more chaotic and event-based [c].\n",
    "​\n",
    "    [insert examples a,b,c]\n",
    "​\n",
    "Combining overall ridership with commuting patterns, we can build you a prioritized list of stations that will give you the most native New Yorkers per street team unit. This can easily be broken down by day, in case there are slight differences among weekdays.\n",
    "​\n",
    "​\n",
    "#### What else we could do:\n",
    "​\n",
    "More fun with MTA data\n",
    "​\n",
    "For this feasibility analysis, we collapsed data to the day and station. This gives us some great information for daily scheduling. We can additionally break this data down into morning and evening ridership, or even the mid-day (lunch hour) interval.\n",
    "​\n",
    "We also noticed that the top stations have much much greater volume than other stations that are still very high up on the list. With more information about the size of your street team force and the number of workers per team, we can build a model that allows more than one team to be deployed to very-high-volume stations\n",
    "​\n",
    "[insert example or doodle]\n",
    "​\n",
    " * seasonal\n",
    " * entrances\n",
    "​\n",
    "#### Adding more data sources (etc.)\n",
    "​\n",
    "Using only the MTA data, we can make some rough guesses about the people who are using the station, based on the weekly patterns of ridership. Beyond that, however, we are fairly blind. To help the WTWY achieve its conversion goals, we have a few ideas that would slightly broaden the scope of this project and result in much greater returns.\n",
    "​\n",
    "Geographic & demographic information about areas around stations\n",
    "​\n",
    "Bring on an ethnographer or marketing specialist to help us create profiles of those most likely to attend the Gala and contribute\n",
    "​\n",
    "Design some A/B tests or similar experiments to gather data informed feedback on signature conversions\n",
    "​\n",
    "On the very-large scale side of things, we could design for you an optimizer that assigns deployments and collects signature results in real time. This did not really sound like the scope of project you were interested in at the time of our conversation, but if it piques your interest we’d could tell you more. Systems like these are often flexible enough to serve multiple marketing and fundraising needs for an organization.\n",
    "​\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "​\n",
    "We had a lot of fun wrangling the mta data and coming up with these simple plots. Based on your interests and scope, we can go ahead with anything discussed above, or meet to iterate on these themes. We’re really looking forward to working with you! Women in tech is an issue we love to support.\n",
